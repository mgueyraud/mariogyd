An attempt of building Family's tray system, inspired by this [example](https://emilkowal.ski/ui/family-tray-system) from [@emilkowalski\_](https://x.com/emilkowalski_)

This example is also used in [animations.dev](https://animations.dev) which is a platform where you can learn animations by [@emilkowalski\_](https://x.com/emilkowalski_) also.
